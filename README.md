# Netflix-Movie-Data-Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This repository presents a data analysis project on Netflix movie data. The core objective is to explore, visualize, and derive insights from a dataset of movies on the streaming platform, focusing on patterns, correlations and key metrics (e.g., by genre, release year, runtime, ratings). The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and accompanying dataset.

## 📊 Contents  
- `mymoviedb.csv` – the dataset containing Netflix movie information (attributes such as title, genre, release year, runtime, IMDb/Netflix rating, etc).  
- `Netflix Movie Data analysis.ipynb` – the Jupyter Notebook housing the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization and interpretive commentary.  
- `README.md` – this documentation file, explaining the project and how to run/extend it.

## 🧠 Motivation  
Streaming platforms like Netflix have become ubiquitous, and understanding the content library can reveal interesting insights about trends in genre preference, movie runtime, rating distributions, and more. Through this project you will:  
- Learn how to load, clean and pre-process real-world datasets.  
- Explore relationships between different movie attributes.  
- Build and interpret visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts).  
- Generate actionable observations: e.g., which genres dominate which years; does runtime correlate with ratings; how ratings vary over time, etc.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- Python (version 3.x)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas (for data manipulation)  
- NumPy (for numerical operations)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- (Optional) any other library you used for enhancements  

## 🧩 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/karthikeyagandepalli/Netflix-Movie-Data-Analysis.git
